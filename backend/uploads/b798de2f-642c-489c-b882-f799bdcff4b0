A graphical Fitch-style natural deduction proof checker, with support for modal logic.
        •        Designed and implemented a proof parser and checker for students in a symbolic logic course, at the suggestion of my
                 professor.
        •        Tested, fuzzed, and subsequently debugged the above for correctness and crash resilience.
        •        Supported modal logic, unique among existing Fitch-style checkers.
